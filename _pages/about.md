I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the College of Information Science & Electronic Engineering (ISEE) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), Hangzhou, China, where I am jointly advised by Prof. [Zhiguo Shi] (Vice dean of the College of ISEE) and Prof. Quan Yu (Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering). From Oct. 2022 ~ Oct. 2023, I was a joint training Ph.D. student in the Department of Acoustics & Signal Processing at Aalto University, Espoo, Finland, where I am supervised by Prof. [Sergiy Vorobyov](https://users.aalto.fi/~vorobys1/). My research interest includes array signal processing, tensor signal processing, and AI for signal processing.
